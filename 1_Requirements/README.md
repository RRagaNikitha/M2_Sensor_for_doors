## Requirements
## INTRODUCTION/RESEARCH:
A door sensor is a peripheral security sensor that lets an alarm system know whether a door is opened or closed. When a door is opened, the sensor will activate and let the system know about the situation. The system will then respond based on the programming settings for that zone.
## FEATURES:
* System sends signal when a person /an object passes through the door.
* Easy to install and use.
* Easy to monitor.
## COMPONENTS REQUIRED (HARDWARE):
* Atmega328-----Qty (1)
* Voltmeter-----Qty (2)
* Resistor of 100-ohm resistance-----Qty (1)
* LED-----Qty (1)
* SPST Switch-----Qty (1)
* Connecting wires
## 4’Ws and 1’H:
* What: Sensor for doors
* Where: Home, Offices, Elevators, etc
* When: Used when one needs it for security purpose
* How: When the door is opened, LED glows and when the door is closed, LED stops glowing
## SWOT ANALYSIS:
* Strengths- Easy installment, User friendly
* Weaknesses- Frequent replacement of battery and switches is required
* Opportunities- Can be used for security purposes
* Threats- Weather changes can cause surfaces to expand and contract, and this can lead to false alarms, too.
## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT:
* Door Sensor(switch) to alert the system
* Voltmeter at pin number 1 of PORT B and pin 6 of PORT C
* LED to alert the people around
* Power supply at pin 1
## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENT:
* Voltmeter should display the voltage value
* LED should glow when door is opened
* LED should not glow when door is closed
